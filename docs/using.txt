Using LiMe
==========

== LuCI

Once you have http://www.libre-mesh.org/getit.html[installed] LiMe onto your router, you can access the administration GUI called LuCI.
Like most things you will encounter, LuCI is not unique to LiME.
It is a common configuration interface for https://github.com/openwrt/luci[OpenWRT].

To access it, connect your computer to the router over ethernet or wifi, open your browser and go to http://anygw[http://anygw] or http://thisnode.info[thisnode.info].

== Connecting to other nodes

Using the IPv4 or the IPv6 you should be able to connect to any node.
It should appear in the menu BMX6 -> Nodes -> (click on the blue circle).

All the nodes are probably in the same collision domain, so you can execute something like: pass:[<code>nmap -sT -p 80 10.X.Y.0/24 --open</code>] to discover the nodes in your network and
their IPv4s.
