== 2025-05-04 - LibreMesh 2024.1 release

The LibreMesh community is enthusiast to finally announce a new release of LibreMesh:
LibreMesh 2024.1 "Fantastic Forwarder".

Four years of work and testing, link:https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/compare/v2020.4...v2024.1[334 commits] since LibreMesh 2020.4 in the lime-packages repository only, 10 developers, many improvements and the updated support for OpenWrt 23.05!

A big news first: this LibreMesh release can be downloaded and customized online (!!!) using a tool developed by the OpenWrt community: the firmware selector. This is a large step forward in one of our main objective: enable everyone to build a network community, without being a shell-ninja. Enjoy it at this link: https://repo.libremesh.org/selector/

=== What's new in 2024.1 "Expansive Emancipation"

It is impossible to do a meaningful list of all the changes. A non complete list of the most relevant
developments:

* Compatibility with the new firewall adopted by modern OpenWrt: nftables;
* Compatibility with the new configuration method for switches (DSA) while maintaining the compatibility with the old one (swconfig);
* Compatibility with the usage of ujail introduced in OpenWrt for additional security;
* Incorporate a link:https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/tree/master/packages/shared-state-async[new version of shared-state] written from scratch for performances;
* Many fixes and code improvement, also coming from the testing grants funded with the link:https://opencollective.com/libremesh[donations collected on OpenCollective].

== 2023-09-06 - LibreMesh on the waves

On Friday the 19th of July, one of us was invited to Radio Campus in Brussels, for the "Radio Source" program, where they talk about current Free Software news and the world of Open Source development.
We had the opportunity to talk with the hosts for about an hour about LibreMesh, why the project was created, how it was used in 2024 and about what a mesh network is, what are its purposes, and what LibreMesh offers regarding mesh networks. 
The archive is available here https://redif.src.brussels/ under 2024 and then select the file from the 19th of July!

== 2023-10-07 - A new stable release and a release candidate for Openwrt 22!

We released a new version of Libremesh based on OpenWrt 19!

     https://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2020.4-ow19/

and a new release candidate based on OpenWrt 22:

     https://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2023.1-rc2-ow22/


[NOTE]
===========
Firmware images of libremesh-2020.4 based on openwrt-19.07.10, were signed with the wrong signing keys.
To install additional `kernel_modules` via `opkg`:

- Add the build repository for the selected `target/subtarget` here *ar71xx/generic*:
```
echo "src/gz libremesh_kmods http://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2020.4-ow19/targets/ar71xx/generic/packages" >> /etc/opkg/limefeeds.conf
```
- Then add the signing key:
```
cat << EOF > /etc/opkg/keys/c37d41571f77f282
untrusted comment: signed by libremesh.org for 2020.4 release builds
RWTDfUFXH3fygrM5F7kON6UQTWjWG9aNVBSNFnUv3cHXJjFVmZrGJ6Iw
EOF
```
===========

This means that the release candidate needs testing, bug fixing and
loads of community love so that we can have an amazing release that can
actually ease the creation of community networks everywhere.
