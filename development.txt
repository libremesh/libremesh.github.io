== The Source Code

The code is stored inside a git tree which contains all branches and releases.

All repositories can be browsed online through https://github.com/libremesh/[GitHub].

Most of the development happens in the _lime-packages_ git repository which can be browsed on https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages[GitHub] or downloaded using git:

----
git clone https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages.git
cd lime-packages
----

== Compiling LibreMesh from source code

This procedure has been tested on GNU/Linux, on other systems it could require some modifications or it can be run in a Linux virtual machine. Generally, the first compilation takes a few hours and requires at least 10 GB of disk space.

First of all you need to install a few packages to your system.
Building OpenWrt requires a bunch of installed software.

If you are unsure about your system having all the dependencies installed, you can just go on with the OpenWrt compilation (see below) and, if it fails, check out the error messages.

On an Ubuntu system, the following command will install the minimum compilation dependencies:

----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends git ca-certificates subversion wget make gcc g++ libncurses5-dev gawk unzip file patch python3-distutils python3-minimal python2-minimal libpython2-stdlib
----

For other Linux distributions the packets list could be slightly different, check out the link:https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem[OpenWrt build system installation page].

Then you need to get the OpenWrt source code.
Make sure to _git clone_ the source code as normal user (i.e. do not use root): the compilation will refuse to run if the administrator user _root_ is being used.

.*Download OpenWrt source code*
LibreMesh can be built on top of OpenWrt version 23.05.5.

For compiling LibreMesh on top of the stable version of OpenWrt, first download the OpenWrt BuildRoot code:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git clone -b v23.05.5 --single-branch https://git.openwrt.org/openwrt/openwrt.git
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.Enter OpenWrt build root
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd openwrt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.Take default OpenWrt repositories feeds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.And add LibreMesh repositories to the OpenWrt feeds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cat << EOF >> feeds.conf

src-git libremesh https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages.git;v2024.1
src-git profiles https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles.git
EOF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the lines above, you will compile the LibreMesh 2024.1 release. This is indicated by the `;v2024.1` suffix. Without this suffix, the `master` branch would be used, but **the `master` branch is *not* compatible with OpenWrt 23.05.5.** Instead, it is being developed for supporting the yet-to-be-released OpenWrt 24.10 version.


.Update the packages from the feeds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scripts/feeds update -a
scripts/feeds install -a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


.Run the configuration menu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make menuconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check out the +target+ (e.g. +ATH79+), +subtarget+ (e.g. +generic+) and +profile+ (e.g. +tl-wdr3600-v1+) of your router on https://openwrt.org/toh/start[OpenWrt table of hardware].

Select the _Target System_, _Subtarget_ and _Target Profile_ accordingly.


**Deselect** erroneous feeds locations:

- Image configuration → Separate feed repositories → Enable feed libremesh
- Image configuration → Separate feed repositories → Enable feed profiles

**Deselect** problematic packages:

- Base system -> dnsmasq
- Network -> odhcpd-ipv6only

Optionally, **deselect** unused packages:
- Network -> ppp

If you local community has a profile in the https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles/[network-profiles repository], you can select it in:

- LibreMesh -> network-profile -> profile-your_community-your_profile

[NOTE]
=========================
Network profiles are the specific configuration from the communities, and are stored in this collective 
https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles/[repository], but they can also be kept locally, depending on how every community network manages itself. For more instructions on how to create a profile or how to use a local one, check out the link:development-network_profiles.html[network profiles page].
=========================

**Select** (press space until when an asterisk appears, like `<*>`) LibreMesh packages:

* LibreMesh → Offline Documentation → lime-docs-minimal (LibreMesh minimal documentation)
* LibreMesh → lime-app (LibreMeshApp)
* LibreMesh → lime-hwd-openwrt-wan (Respect openwrt wan interface as default)
* LibreMesh → lime-proto-anygw (LibreMesh anygw proto support)
* LibreMesh → lime-proto-babeld (LibreMesh babeld proto support)
* LibreMesh → lime-proto-batadv (LibreMesh batman-adv proto support)
* LibreMesh → shared-state
** shared-state-babeld_hosts (babeld-hosts module for shared-state)
** shared-state-bat_hosts (bat-hosts module for shared-state)
** shared-state-nodes_and_links (nodes_and_links module for shared-state)
* LibreMesh -> babeld-auto-gw-mode

[NOTE]
=========================
If after the compilation you don't see the compiled image in the `bin/targets/.../.../` folder, it is possible that your router has such a small flash memory that the aforementioed packages don't fit in it (it can happen also with routers having 8 MB of flash memory when selecting huge packages to be included). In this case, you can remove the `.config` generated packages list and repeat the packages selection without including `lime-app`. If the compiled image is still too large, try selecting only `lime-proto-anygw`, `lime-proto-batadv` and `lime-proto-babeld` or following https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/saving_space[this guide].
=========================

Some more packages are recommended but not mandatory for a working LibreMesh network. Consider avoiding to select the following packages _only_ if the created image is too large and does not fit in the router memory.

- LibreMesh -> check-date-http (Keep local date under NTP too far away skew)
- LibreMesh -> Offline Documentation -> lime-docs (LibreMesh full documentation)
- LibreMesh -> lime-debug (libremesh debug utils)

Additionally and optionally, httpS for the web interface can be enabled selecting (beware that the web interace will be shown as *not trusted*):

- Utilities -> Encryption -> px5g-standalone

Finally, also the 802.11s mesh connections can be password protected, this will require a specific configuration and this package to be selected:

- Network -> wpad-mesh-openssl

and this to be **de**-selected:

- Network -> wpad-basic-mbedtls

[NOTE]
=========================
In order to have additional packages, the easiest way is to select them in menuconfig. More packages can be installed afterwards via +opkg+, but some of these require a specific kernel configuration to be in place. This can be achieved following link:development-kernel_vermagic.html[these additional instructions dealing with kernel vermagic]. Beware that this will increase noticeably the time and storage space required for the compilation.
=========================

Save and exit.

At this stage there is the possibility to include custom files in the compiled firmware image. For this, you will have to create, inside the `openwrt/` directory, a `files/` directory containing the directory structure and files you want to add. For example, if you want to have a `/etc/config/lime-community` file you need to do the following:

-----------------------------
mkdir -p files/etc/config/
touch files/etc/config/lime-community
-----------------------------

and then edit the newly created `lime-community` file including your custom content. If a file from a package has the same name and path as a file in this directory, it will be overwritten. This is a quick way to include a custom configuration file, without the need to create an online link:development-network_profiles.html[network profile].

.Finally, compile the images
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make -j$(nproc)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If everything goes well you should find the produced binaries inside the +bin/+ directory.

== Emulating on your computer with qemu

Its possible to emulate a image compiled for x86_64 architecture. See link:https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/tree/master/tools[script] qemu_dev_start.sh and qemu_dev_stop.sh scripts.

[NOTE]
=========================
You will be running something like:
```
sudo ./qemu_dev_start openwrt-x86-64-combined-ext4.img openwrt-x86-64-ramfs.bzImage
```
