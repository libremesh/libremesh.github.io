This is the repository of the Libre-Mesh web pages.

All pages should be written using asciidoc syntax

Top level pages are located in this directory while the "Documentation"
can be found in the docs/ sub-folder.

The website is generated from asciidoc using jekyll invoked by a cron script
every 15 minutes.

In order to generate the pages locally for testing your changes,
install https://jekyllrb.com/, issue "jekyll serve" and navigate to
http://127.0.0.1:4000/ with your browser.

Jekyll and its dependencies can also be installed using gem and boundle:

gem install bundler
cd lime-web && bundler install
jekyll build
